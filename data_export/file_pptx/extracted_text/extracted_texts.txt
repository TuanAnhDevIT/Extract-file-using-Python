Client-Server Architecture
A revolution in networking
Client-Server Architecture
Machines are expensive, applications are complex
Seperate the application into two components 
Expensive workload can be done on the server
Clients call servers to perform expensive tasks
Remote procedure call (RPC) was born
Client-Server Architecture Benefits
Servers have beefy hardware
Clients have commodity hardware  
Clients can still perform lightweight tasks
Clients no longer require 
dependencies
However, we need a communication model
OSI Model
Open Systems Interconnection model
husseinnasser
Why do we need a communication model?
Agnostic applications
Without a standard model, your application must have knowledge of the underlying network medium 
Imagine if you have to author different version of your apps so that it works on wifi vs ethernet vs LTE vs fiber
Network 
Equipment
 Management
Without a standard model, upgrading network equipments becomes difficult
Decoupled 
Innovation
Innovations
 can be done in each layer 
separately
 without affecting the rest  of the models

What is the OSI Model?
7 Layers each describe a specific networking component 
Layer 7 - Application - HTTP/FTP/gRPC
Layer 6 - Presentation - Encoding, 
Serialization
 
Layer 5 - Session - Connection establishment, TLS
Layer 4 - Transport - UDP/TCP
Layer 3 - Network - IP
Layer 2 - Data link - Frames, Mac address Ethernet
Layer 1 - Physical - Electric signals, fiber or radio waves
husseinnasser
The OSI Layers - an Example (Sender)
Example sending a POST request to an HTTPS webpage
Layer 7 - Application
POST request with JSON data to HTTPS server  
Layer 6 - Presentation
Serialize
 JSON to 
flat byte
 strings
Layer 5 - Session
Request to 
establish
 TCP connection/TLS 
Layer 4 - Transport
Sends SYN request target port 443
Layer 3 - Network
 SYN is placed an IP packet(s) and adds the source/dest IPs 
Layer 2 - Data link 
Each packet goes into a single frame and adds the source/dest MAC addresses
Layer 1 - Physical
Each frame becomes string of bits which converted into either a radio signal (wifi), electric signal (ethernet), or light (fiber) 
Take it with a grain of salt, 
it's
 not always cut and dry
husseinnasser
The OSI Layers - an Example (Receiver)
Receiver computer receives the POST request the other way around 
Layer 1 - Physical 
Radio, electric or light is received and converted into digital bits
Layer 2 - Data link 
The bits from Layer 1 is assembled into frames
Layer 3 - Network
The frames from layer 2 are assembled into IP packet. 
Layer 4 - Transport
The IP packets from layer 3 are assembled into TCP segments
Deals with Congestion control/flow control/retransmission in case of TCP
If Segment is SYN we donâ€™t need to go further into more layers as we are still processing the connection request
Layer 5 - Session
The connection session is established or identified
We only arrive at this layer when necessary (three way handshake is done)
Layer 6 - Presentation
Deserialize flat byte strings back to JSON for the app to consume
Layer 7 - Application
Application understands the JSON POST request and your express json or apache request receive event is triggered
Take it with a grain of salt, it's not always cut and dry
