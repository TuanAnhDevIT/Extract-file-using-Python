The OSI Layers - an Example (Receiver)
Receiver computer receives the POST request the other way around 
Layer 1 - Physical 
Radio, electric or light is received and converted into digital bits
Layer 2 - Data link 
The bits from Layer 1 is assembled into frames
Layer 3 - Network
The frames from layer 2 are assembled into IP packet. 
Layer 4 - Transport
The IP packets from layer 3 are assembled into TCP segments
Deals with Congestion control/flow control/retransmission in case of TCP
If Segment is SYN we donâ€™t need to go further into more layers as we are still processing the connection request
Layer 5 - Session
The connection session is established or identified
We only arrive at this layer when necessary (three way handshake is done)
Layer 6 - Presentation
Deserialize flat byte strings back to JSON for the app to consume
Layer 7 - Application
Application understands the JSON POST request and your express json or apache request receive event is triggered
Take it with a grain of salt, it's not always cut and dry
